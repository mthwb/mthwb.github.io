                    Ark's Cafe was born in 1984 in the small town of Baywood Park, CA. The founder, Norman Galloway, and his wife, Gail, worked long hours researching and perfecting our signature Aroma roasting technique. This roasting technique ensures a full flavor coffee without the burnt or unfavorable characteristics of other brands. Combined with high grade green beans and diligence to freshness Norman created the foundation for Ark's Cafe.Thirty one years later the company is owned by the second generation of coffee entrepreneurs, daughter, Julie, and son, Chris. With the foundation of service and quality we have held true to the values our father created.
