                            <h2>We just have to stick together.</h2>
                    
                                <p>Despite Wolves heading into the break propping up the league standings, the defender has praised the effort and commitment of his teammates since Steve Davis and James Collins took on the reins, and feels they can improve even further once they are working under new head coach Julen Lopetegui. “They’ve taken on a tough job, and it wasn’t easy for them, but Steve and James have come in and helped us, they’ve worked hard with us, and I can’t thank them enough.</p>

                                <p>“We showed hard work, we showed what they wanted from us and if we can work on that, then we’ll be fine. “I think we defended a bit too much. We probably could have got control on the game and our foot in the game a bit more, because we have the ability and I know confidence might be a bit low, but for future, we know that we can defend as a team, and we know we can counter that, so we can change our ways, which is good.” He’s been in, but he hasn’t spoken to us yet as a group. He said he wanted to leave Steve and James to it with their final game, because they’ve worked hard and they deserved this. He’s just been saying hello and asking how we are, as he was trying to keep out of the way as much as possible, but I’ll see him in a few weeks.</p>

                                <h2>It's time to fight, it's time to work.</h2>

                                <p>The old gold competed for large spells, and had chances of their own, but once Odegaard tapped the visitors ahead, they gained a level of control on the fixture. With 15 minutes remaining the Gunners midfielder slammed home the second, meaning Wolves enter the World Cup period on the back of a defeat. Molineux under the lights is a special place and the introduction of Lopetegui added that extra spice to the atmosphere, as the new head coach was welcomed to Molineux for the first time, before taking up a watching brief for Steve Davis’ final first-team assignment, which started promisingly against the leaders.</p>

                                <p>The Gunners will be top at Christmas, but knew they were in a game in the West Midlands. Although Gabriel headed the first chance of the game wide, Goncalo Guedes came closest to an opener in the first 25 minutes when Nelson Semedo led a rapid Wolves counter attack and played in his compatriot, who fired just wide of the near top post, having struck first time on the run. Arsenal have been free-scoring this season, but were finding life more difficult at Molineux. They did, however, come close the opener just after the half-hour mark when Bukayo Saka carried the ball down the middle and played in Gabriel Jesus, who continued into the box and cut in on his right, before striking off the top of the crossbar.
                                Guedes got off the mark against Brighton and Hove Albion last weekend and was Wolves’ main threat in the opening half. When he sniffed out a defensive mistake from William Saliba, he jumped on his poor back pass and was in, however, as he shaped to curl into the far corner, Gabriel came across to deflect the shot wide.</p>

                                <h2>Pride in the pack.</h2>
                    
                                <p>Boubacar Traore’s first goal for Wolves was the difference on a night where the hosts – who made six changes to the side which started at home to Brighton at the weekend – were more than worthy of their victory over Leeds United in the third round, and Davis was pleased with the efforts of his players as they provided a much-needed lift to the supporters.</p>

                                <p>“I’m just delighted with the result. Cup games are all about winning, and we haven’t won many games, so it’s nice to win the game and get through.</p>

                                <p>“We didn’t start particularly well, and it’s not how we planned to start. We could have relieved the pressure a lot easier instead of three successive corners and scrambles in the box, so it’s something we need to learn from and get better from. Matija [Sarkic] was the only one who was ready for the start, and it’s a good job that he was because he made two or three fantastic saves for us.</p>

                                <p>“But after that, I thought we controlled a lot of the game, particularly the first-half, and we created a few chances. It was nice to score in that time of the game, when it’s tight.</p>

                                <p>“We were looking at penalty takers and wondering how we were going to score. Both teams almost resigned themselves to penalties at the end, because the second-half was a bit scrappy. In the end, it’s been a really good night for us.”</p>

                                <h2>Fane Zone.</h2>
                    
                                <p>Wolves scored twice in the Premier League for the first time this season, but despite their best efforts, the old gold’s ten men were beaten 3-2 by Brighton and Hove Albion, who struck the winner inside the final ten minutes, following an eventful Molineux afternoon.</p>

                                <p>Earlier in the afternoon, the old gold had overturned Brighton’s early lead, given to them by Adam Lallana, as Goncalo Guedes and a Ruben Neves penalty put Wolves in front, but the Seagulls levelled through Kaoru Mitoma, who was then hauled down by Nelson Semedo for a first-half red card.</p>

                                <p>It took a while for that advantage to tell, as Wolves continued to battle for what would have been a deserved point, but Pascal Gross slid in seven minutes from time to earn the visitors the win.</p>

                                <p>Molineux fixtures this season haven’t been known for their lively starts, but on Bonfire Night, this game took little time to spark into life. Nathan Collins had already produced two vital blocks to deny Solly March in the opening stages, but when Leandro Trossard played in Lallana, he guided into the top corner to give the visitors an early lead.</p>

                                <p>At Brentford last week, Wolves responded to falling behind within two minutes, and history repeated itself at Molineux this time. Boubacar Traore’s brilliant through ball freed Guedes, who carried the ball into the box and, despite being on the fall, sorted his feet to shift the ball out of the way of Robert Sanchez for his first Wolves goal.</p>

                                <p>That goal was the perfect response, and on 35 minutes, Wolves continued the positivity. Daniel Podence’s cross was hopeful more than anything else, but Lewis Dunk left a raised arm in the air and made contact. After a lengthy VAR check, the penalty was given, and Neves fired high to Sanchez’s right to make it 2-1.</p>

                                <p>However, Wolves would be denied the luxury of going in for the break ahead, as Albion found their equaliser with half-time approaching. Lallana turned provider this time, helping the ball to the back post, where Mitoma got the better of Semedo in the air to nod past Jose Sa.</p>

                                <p>That wasn’t Semedo’s final involvement in the half however, as his dismissal just before the break changed the complexion of the game. Mitoma got away from the full-back and was hauled down with both arms – red card for Semedo and 45 minutes a man light for Wolves.</p>
