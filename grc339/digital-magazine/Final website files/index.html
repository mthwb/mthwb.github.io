                                    Despite seeing his side pose 21 shots at the Leicester goal, the head coach has bemoaned his side’s lack of clinical finishing compared to the Foxes, while also pointing out the lapse defending of the team, but believes the players will be doing everything they can to stick together and look at the positives ahead of a trip to Brentford on Saturday.

                                    Davis was at the King Power Stadium on Thursday, watching a Foxes side fight for every ball, and now he wants his players to find a balance between showing their technical quality and working harder than their opposition. The old gold showed that required spirit against Nottingham Forest last weekend and Davis wants that same approach as Wolves face four of their next five fixtures on home soil at Molineux.

                                    Hosted by Dicky Dodd, the Fan Zone will open at 11am and re-open after the game and is the perfect place to enjoy a pre-match atmosphere ahead of kick-off as well as reflect on the game post-match. As well as all the usual entertainment and food and drink on offer to get supporters in the mood for the 2pm kick-off, the Fan Zone will also welcome former Wolves defender Christophe Berra who will answer questions put to him by supporters.
